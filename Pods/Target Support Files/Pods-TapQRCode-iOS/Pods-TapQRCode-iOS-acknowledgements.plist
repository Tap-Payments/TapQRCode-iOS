------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These Masterpass QR ("MPQR") App and Software Development Kit Terms of Use 
("TOU") are a binding legal contract between you (a legal entity) and MasterCard 
International Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of 
business at 2000 Purchase Street, Purchase, New York 10577 ("MasterCard" or "we").  

"Licensed Materials" means the software development kit and the mobile 
app, that comprise source code, code libraries, application programming 
interface specifications, developer guides, brand guidelines and other documentation 
associated with MasterCard's MPQR, Moneysend and Optical Code Standards.

By downloading, installing, accessing or using the Licensed Materials you will
be bound by the terms of these TOU.  If you do not agree to the terms of these
TOU, MasterCard is not willing to grant you any right to use or access the 
Licensed Materials. In such event, you may not download, install, access, use 
or copy the Licensed Materials.

MasterCard may amend these TOU at any time by posting a revised version on 
https://developer.mastercard.com/product/masterpass-qr.  
The revised version will be effective at the time MasterCard posts it.

acceptance device including but not limited to Near Field Communication, Bluetooth 
or SMS based acceptance, provided that such Licensee Applications shall solely 
support transactions using MasterCard and Maestro cards, or transactions using

(ii) you retain responsibility for all obligations under these TOU.

(c) All rights not expressly granted herein to you are reserved to MasterCard.  You shall not use
